# What Should I Make?
### An API for hungry people who need some inspiration.

Maybe you're trying to learn how to cook. Maybe you're just looking for something new to try. Maybe you want to look for a recipe that features
your favorite ingredient, but in a new way. Maybe you don't want to find
a fun new recipe in a cookbook and then realize you only have half the ingredients at home; you don't want to make a whole trip to the store for one dish- you just want to make dinner!

What Should I Make? is here to help.
Enter in the ingredients you already have on hand in your cabinets, fridge & freezer. Find recipes, detailed instructions, and satisfaction.
